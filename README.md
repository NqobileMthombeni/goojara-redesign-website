mRedesign of Goojara Website

For my web development project, I chose to redesign the Goojara website, a popular streaming platform. The goal was to create a more modern and user-friendly interface while maintaining the essence of the original site. I started by updating the logo and navigation menu to give it a cleaner look. Then, I redesigned the banner section to showcase movie details more prominently, including adding movie title images and improving the readability of the synopsis. The carousel-box was also enhanced to provide a smoother browsing experience, allowing users to click on movie images to change the background and title dynamically. Furthermore, I implemented a search feature using the OMDB API to allow users to search for movies easily. Overall, the redesigned Goojara website provides a more visually appealing and intuitive platform for users to enjoy their favorite movies and TV shows.
